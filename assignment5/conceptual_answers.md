Hospital:
A use case that motivates this question would be the person at the hospital tasked with ordering supplies from distributors being interested in finding out what quantity of each medication is needed to be kept in stock. The numbers settled on would need to take into account multiple factors such as the regular demand, as well as the peak demand of each medication. Also, the expiry date and storage facilities needed are also important to keep in mind.

Real world impacts:
The real world contains far too many variables and uncertainties to be able to be analyzed with just a few lines of code. To take into account this variability, our code needs to be able to categorize data more broadly, and thus the complexity increases to cover for the new cases.
